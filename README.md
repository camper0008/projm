dumb (as in 'simple', 'not smart') project management

## ideology

the user(s) of this software

1. wants to be able to group tasks into reasonable, titled sections
2. wants to be able to organize tasks under tasks under tasks - i.e. splitting a
   larger task into many smaller subtasks
3. wants tasks to display only the information required to complete the task &
   force the user to condense all the required information in the same screen in
   which it's viewed

- reason: if the user has to click into a menu view the details of a task, in a
  sea of a thousand other tasks, it's not gonna happen

4. wants to force the user(s) to not spend more time creating tasks than solving
   them
5. wants to be able to create, delete and move tasks
6. wants to be able to accomplish the above goals with ease - i.e. no extensive
   menuing, as these are the primary uses of the software
